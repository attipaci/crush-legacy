## Introduction

This is the legacy fork of the [crush](https://github.com/attipaci/crush) 
astronomical data reduction and imaging package that supports instruments 
which have been dropped from the main-line releases of **CRUSH** at version 
2.50 (or after). Specifically, this version maintains support for: ASZCa, 
p-ArTeMiS, MAKO, MAKO-2, MUSTANG-2 and SHARC (1st gen). For all other 
instruments, it is recommended that you use the latest main-line release.

This legacy version of CRUSH has a frozen set of features, and is maintained
only with essential bug fixes, and nothing more. It is supported by the 
designated [jnum-legacy](https://github.com/attipaci/jnum-legacy) fork.
